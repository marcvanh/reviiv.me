## How does ReViiV work?

[Post-viral researchers](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/) have found the virus can impact the auto-immune system and reduce breathing quality, leading to an ongoing imbalance of CO2 in the body. Other [researchers](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.220492) have found ongoing blockages in the small capillaries within the upper lungs, further impairing breathing.

**ReViiV addresses both issues** – first by modifying breathing patterns to rapidly improve CO2/O2 levels in the body, and second by using guided daily breathing exercises that leverage the lower, healthier lungs to steadily increase capacity. The program is 16-weeks and benefits may be noticeable already within 24 hours.

This breathwork therapy was first tested on Post-Viral patients at Mt. Sinai Hospital in 2021. The results showed that after a week, “everyone in the pilot program reported improvement in symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue”. The FDA has also “fast tracked” the therapy and will not require approval [LINK](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/).
