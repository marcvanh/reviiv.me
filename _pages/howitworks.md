Kickstart your Long COVID recovery with ReViiV, a pioneering mobile app offering tailored breathing exercises for rapid relief, often starting in 24 hours. Imagine less fatigue, clearer thinking, and the return of taste/smell – all possible through our tailored breathing program. With eight scientifically backed techniques including paced, nasal, prolonged exhalation and diaphragmatic breathing, this is more than deep breaths; it's about reclaiming your health. While ReViiV can't promise full recovery, it can significantly relieve Long COVID symptoms, making it more manageable and comfortable.

ReViiV's regimen is designed to quickly mitigate a broad spectrum of Long COVID symptoms, including, but not limited to:

- Decreased fatigue
- Regained taste and smell
- Improved lung function and respiratory health
- Enhanced sleep quality
- Relieved muscle aches and joint pains
- Relief from 'brain fog' and headaches
- Reduced breathlessness
- Reduced inflammation
- Reduced stress and anxiety

**Tailored Exercises Promote Recovery**

ReViiV uses brief, user-friendly daily breathing exercises, progressively tailored to each user, to both relieve Long COVID symptoms and facilitate steady, incremental recovery. Weekly assessments and performance graphs provide a visual of your progress over time.  ReViiV also includes clear instructions with visual aids along with additional guides and resources to ensure you maintain proper technique.

**Harnesses Eight Scientifically Backed Techniques**

ReViiV's effectiveness stems from its incorporation of eight scientifically proven techniques into its highly effective breathing program.  These techniques include:

1. **Nasal Breathing**: ReViiV promotes breathing through your nose all the time to increase the efficiency of your lungs, improve oxygen intake, reduce fatigue, and help restore taste & smell.
1. **Prolonged Exhalation**: By emphasizing long exhales in the breathing exercises, ReViiV aims to reduce breathlessness, relax your body, improve your sleep, and improve lung function.
1. **Diaphragm Activation**: ReViiV encourages deep 'belly breathing' to improve your lung function, reduce fatigue and shortness of breath. By stimulating the nervous system, it also reduces stress and anxiety, enhancing well-being.
1. **Regulated Oxygen/CO2 Balance**: ReViiV aims to improve your lung capacity and balance the levels of oxygen and CO2 in your body by fostering the Bohr Effect, helping to alleviate symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, and brain fog.
1. **Regulated Immune System Activity**: ReViiV's breathing exercises are designed to keep your immune system in check, reducing inflammation and other immune-related symptoms often seen in Long COVID patients.
1. **Structured Olfactory Re-training**: ReViiV introduces specific exercises that can enhance your sensitivity to smell and taste, especially useful for Long COVID patients.
1. **Breath-Holding**: When you're ready, ReViiV introduces daily breath-holding exercises to help your body adapt to high	er CO2 levels, improving overall body efficiency.
1. **Stress Reduction and Mindfulness**: ReViiV also includes mindfulness techniques to help reduce fatigue, improve sleep, and combat stress, anxiety, and depression.

**Bolstered by Promising Early Trials**

ReViiV uses a scientifically grounded approach that has shown significant promise in early trials. In one such preliminary study, Long COVID patients consistently reported significant improvements in their symptoms, often starting within 24 hours of using ReViiV daily, and these benefits enhanced progressively over the six-week trial. These improvements include all the symptoms previously listed. These encouraging results mirror the findings of similar preliminary studies by the Mt. Sinai Center for Post-COVID Care, providing additional support for ReViiV's potential effectiveness.
