**Why does ReViiV work?**

Long Covid researchers have found Covid-19 can impact the auto-immune system and reduce ongoing breathing quality, leading to [improper levels of CO2](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/) and [O2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.861703/full) in the body.  Other researchers have found [blockages in the small capillaries of the upper lungs](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.220492) of Long Covid patients, further impairing breathing quality.

***Long Covid patients tend to breathe shallow and thru their mouths, leading to a host of ongoing issues***

**ReViiV uses a custom breathing therapy to address this in 3 ways:**  First by modifying daily breathing patterns to rapidly improve CO2/O2 levels in the body.  Second, by using a guided daily breathing program to steadily re-build lung capacity over 16 weeks.  And finally, by using only nose breathing, ReViiV can further [improve airflow to arteries, veins and nerves](https://www.healthline.com/health/nose-breathing#:~:text=Nose%20breathing%20is%20more%20beneficial,bad%20breath%20and%20gum%20inflammation.) by warming the air and using the lower, healthier portion of the lungs.

***Rapidly correcting C02/O2 levels while gradually improving breathing quality is the foundation of ReViiV***

This therapy was first [tested on Long Covid patients at Mt. Sinai Hospital](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/) where after a week, “everyone in the pilot program reported improvement in symptoms”.  [The FDA has also “fast tracked” the therapy](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/) for treating Long Covid and said they will not require approval.  Google and Apple have also recently approved ReViiV for global distribution.

Co-developed with Long Covid experts, Doctors & patients, ReViiV can alleviate many Long Covid symptoms, often within 24 hours.  ReViiV was designed to bring relief & recovery to the millions of people suffering from Long Covid globally, including the App’s creator.

***ReViiV is a 16-week guided program, however, benefits may be noticeable within 24 hours***

In addition to relieving Long Covid symptoms, ReViiV can also have [many other health benefits, including:  ](https://www.healthline.com/health/nose-breathing#:~:text=Nose%20breathing%20is%20more%20beneficial,bad%20breath%20and%20gum%20inflammation.)

- Strengthening your diaphragm
- Lowering your risk of allergies by filtering dust, allergens & pollen
- Warming & moisturizing the air, making it easier to process
- Reducing bad breath, tooth decay and gum disease
- Reducing or eliminating snoring
