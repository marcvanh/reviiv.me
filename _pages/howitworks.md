<h2 align="center"> Why Does ReViiV Work? </h2>

Co-developed with Long Covid patients, doctors and breathing experts, ReViiV can alleviate many LC symptoms, often in as soon as 24 hours.  The following is a hypothesis of why ReViiV is so effective at treating LC symptoms.

<h3 align="center"> ReViiV is based on groundbreaking<br>Long Covid research & trials </h3>

Long Covid researchers have found that COVID-19 can impact the auto-immune system and reduce breathing quality, leading to ongoing [improper levels of CO2](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/) and [O2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.861703/full) in the body.  Researchers have also found ongoing [blockages in the small capillaries of the upper lungs](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.220492) of LC patients, further impairing breathing quality and compounding issues.

<h3 align="center"> Long Covid patients tend to breathe shallow,<br>through their mouths, leading to many chronic issues </h3>

**ReViiV uses a custom breathing therapy designed to address these underlying issues in three ways:**  

1. First, by radically altering breathing patterns, ReViiV can rapidly improve CO2 & O2 levels in the body for immediate relief.
1. Second, by using a 16-week, guided daily breathing program, ReViiV can gradually rebuild lost lung capacity.  
1. Third, by using nasal breathing to warm the air & funnel it to the lower, healthier lungs, ReViiV can [improve airflow to arteries, veins & nerves](https://www.healthline.com/health/nose-breathing#:~:text=Nose%20breathing%20is%20more%20beneficial,bad%20breath%20and%20gum%20inflammation.) and [extract more oxygen](https://www.drgalante.com/sleep-apnea/benefits-breathing-through-nose/) from each breath.

The therapy behind ReViiV was first [tested on LC patients at Mt. Sinai Center for Post Covid Care in 2021, ](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/)where after a week, “everyone in the pilot program reported improvement in symptoms”.  The ReViiV team had also similar success in internal pilot testing with LC patients in 2022 and [the FDA has said they have “fast tracked” the therapy](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/) given its efficacy for treating LC.

In addition to relieving LC symptoms, by using focusing on nasal breathing, ReViiV has [many additional health benefits, including:  ](https://www.healthline.com/health/nose-breathing#:~:text=Nose%20breathing%20is%20more%20beneficial,bad%20breath%20and%20gum%20inflammation.) 

- Increasing oxygen uptake and circulation
- Lowering your risk of allergies by filtering dust, allergens & pollen
- Reducing bad breath, tooth decay and gum disease
- Strengthening your diaphragm
- Reducing coughing and snoring
