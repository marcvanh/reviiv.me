**ReViiV  -  FAQ**

**What is ReViiV?**

ReViiV is a guided breathing therapy designed to relieve common Post-Covid or “Long Covid” symptoms by changing breathing patterns and gradually rehabilitate breathing quality.

**What Long Covid Symptoms may ReViiV relieve?**

In pilot testing, ReViiV has shown it can alleviate many common symptoms, including fatigue, loss of taste/smell, shortness of breath, brain fog and more.  Individual results may vary.

**How quickly does ReViiV begin to work?**

ReViiV may begin to relieve common symptoms within days and often starting within 24 hours.  Some symptoms such as Brain Fog required a week of use before.  Nearly all pilot test patients reported positive results within a week of beginning the ReViiV therapy.

**Who are the developers of ReViiV?**

ReViiV was created by a Long Covid patient along with his two brothers.  Additional inputs were received from breathing coaches as well as Long Covid patients, doctors & experts, and many other talented contributors.

**What do I need to do the ReViiV therapy?**

All you need for the ReViiV therapy is the App and an Android or Apple smartphone or tablet.

**What is the science behind ReViiV?**

Long Covid researchers have found that Covid-19 can impact the auto-immune system and reduce breathing quality, leading to an ongoing imbalance of CO2 in the body [Mt Sinai Hospital, 2022].  By introducing a breathing therapy to correct this imbalance, “after a week, everyone in the pilot program reported improvement in symptoms” [“[Understanding Long Covid](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/03/atlantic-daily-understanding-long-covid/618232/)”, Caroline Mimbs Nyce, The Atlantic, 2021].   Quickly correcting this C02 imbalance while gradually improving breathing quality may help relieve many Long Covid symptoms [John Hopkins University, 2021] and is the foundation of the ReViiV therapy.

Additionally, researchers from 6 leading Canadian hospitals have recently found that Covid-19 can impact the small capillaries, often within the upper lungs. [<https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.220492>, 6/2022].   By breathing fully through your nose instead of your mouth, you can increase the oxygen going to the lower, healthier portion of the lungs.
