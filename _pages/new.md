**Why Does ReViiV Work?  The Science Behind ReViiV**

The scientific hypothesis behind the ReViiV app and its daily breathing exercises is that they can help alleviate Long Covid symptoms by addressing the underlying causes of the condition, which are not yet fully understood. It is believed that Long Covid symptoms are caused by a chronic imbalance of CO2 and oxygen in the body, which can be caused by poor breathing quality. The daily breathing exercises included in the app are designed to improve breathing quality and correct this imbalance, which in turn can help alleviate Long Covid symptoms.

One of the key components of ReViiV's daily breathing exercises is the use of the nose. Nose breathing has been shown to have several benefits for respiratory function, including increasing the amount of oxygen taken in and decreasing the amount of CO2 exhaled. By practicing nose breathing exercises daily, users of the app may be able to improve their breathing quality and correct the chronic imbalance of CO2 and oxygen in their bodies.

Another important aspect of ReViiV's daily breathing exercises is the focus on diaphragmatic breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing is a type of breathing that emphasizes the use of the diaphragm, a muscle located at the base of the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, it expands the lungs and increases the volume of air that can be inhaled. By training the body to use the diaphragm more effectively, ReViiV's daily exercises may help to improve overall lung function, including the ability to effectively exchange CO2 and Oxygen.

It's also important to mention that ReViiV's daily breathing exercises are designed to be progressive. As the user's progress is monitored through weekly progress tests, the app automatically adjusts the intensity of the exercises to match the user's progress. This gradual progression allows the body to adapt to the new breathing patterns, making it more likely that the changes will be sustained over time.

The weekly progress tests included in ReViiV also play a crucial role in the hypothesis. These tests allow users to track their progress and monitor the effectiveness of the breathing exercises. This can help to identify any areas that need improvement and make adjustments to the exercises accordingly, ensuring maximum effectiveness.

The brain fog and fatigue symptoms that are common in Long Covid patients may also be related to this chronic imbalance of CO2 and oxygen in the body. The brain requires a constant supply of oxygen to function properly, and an imbalance in the levels of CO2 and oxygen can disrupt this process. By improving breathing quality and correcting the imbalance, ReViiV's breathing exercises may help to improve brain function and reduce brain fog and fatigue.

Another symptom that is common among Long Covid patients is loss of taste and smell. Research has shown that there is a connection between the sense of smell and the respiratory system, and that poor breathing quality can disrupt the proper functioning of the olfactory system. By improving breathing quality, the ReViiV app's exercises may help to improve the sense of smell and taste.

Additionally, Shortness of breath is also a common symptom in Long Covid patients, and it is believed to be related to the chronic imbalance of CO2 and oxygen in the body. By improving breathing quality and correcting this imbalance, the ReViiV app's exercises may help to reduce shortness of breath
